# CVE-2022-1388 Poc by PsychoSec
Improved POC for CVE-2022-1388 that affects multiple F5 products.

This is an improved version of Horizon3's Proof of Concept for CVE-2022-1388:
 https://github.com/horizon3ai/CVE-2022-1388

This version contains multiple improvements as well as an interactive shell to run remote commands.

## Important: 
***Please note that while running the interactive shell on an unpatched system, certain commands and syntax's might not work or give you an expected result. This is probably due to the use of JSON in server API requests and resposes. To avoid any issues try not to use characters that are common to JSON syntax such as double quotes, colons, commas, curly braces, and brackets when using the interactive shell. This dose unfortunately render some commands un-useable. It is also not possible to change directories using the 'cd' command.*** 

***In any case you should still be able to get basic command output nontheless. However, some commands might return empty repsponses with no output, so it is not a gaurentee that all commands will give you the desired output or result that you expect. This dose not mean the command is not executed though.***
